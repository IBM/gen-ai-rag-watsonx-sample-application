# Gen AI - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) - Sample Application
This sample application and data enables generative AI RAG pattern with watsonx Assistant.

Use the [RAG Pattern deployable architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/7a4d68b4-cf8b-40cd-a3d1-f49aff526eb3/architecture/Retrieval_Augmented_Generation_Pattern-5fdd0045-30fc-4013-a8bc-6db9d5447a52-global) to deploy it to IBM Cloud Code Engine or RedHat OpenShift.

The deployable architecture also deploys and configures the relevant generative AI RAG services (watsonx.ai, watsonx Assistant), data (Elasticsearch), and other supporting services for logging, monitoring, security and compliance. The configurations are flexible and can be changed to meet the needs for several types of RAG patterns depending on the chosen combination of technologies and services.
