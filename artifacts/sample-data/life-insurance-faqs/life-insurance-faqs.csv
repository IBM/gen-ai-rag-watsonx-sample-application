life-insurance-faq-1,Do I need life insurance?,"Life insurance may be unnecessary if you don't have anyone depending on your financial support (e.g., no children or dependents). However, it provides several important benefits: serving as income replacement during one's absence, offering mortgage protection for homeowners, aiding in efficient estate planning, facilitating the transfer of wealth, and covering final expenses related to burial. In cases where others count on your financial contributions, life insurance is indispensable."
life-insurance-faq-1,How can I save money when buying life insurance?,"Purchasing term life or bundled term and whole life insurance early in life typically leads to lower overall costs. This is because insurers generally charge lower premiums for younger policyholders, who represent less risk. Conversely, older individuals often face higher premium amounts due to their increased likelihood of mortality risks. Therefore, securing coverage at an earlier age can help you secure more affordable rates."
life-insurance-faq-1,How does the insurance company determine my premium?,"Premium rates are typically based on factors such as age, gender, height, weight, health status (including whether you use tobacco), and if you participate in
high-risk activities or occupations."
life-insurance-faq-1,What is a permanent policy?,"When it comes to securing lifelong protection or building up a tax-deferred cash reserve, permanent insurance plans are usually the way to go. These policies allocate part of your premiums towards accumulating cash value. This accumulated cash value can be utilized in various ways, such as obtaining loans against it or covering your premiums once your policy matures and becomes fully paid up."
life-insurance-faq-1,"Once I buy the policy, will I even need to change my insurance coverage?","When evaluating insurance policies, consider that existing coverage may offer lower premiums compared to newly purchased ones. For instance, when acquiring a long-term policy, its initial cash value tends to be modest. Therefore, if there are substantial alterations in your personal situation, it could be advantageous to explore purchasing a fresh policy instead."
life-insurance-faq-1,What does it mean when a policy is fully paid up?,"Fully paid up means that you have paid enough premiums to cover the cost of the policy for the rest of your life, and the company will use the cash value to pay your premiums until you die."
life-insurance-faq-1,What happens if I miss a premium payment?,"Most insurance policies come with a 31-day grace period during which late payments incur no penalty or interest charges. For term life insurance policies, missing the deadline results in policy termination; however, if you hold a permanent policy, you may allow the insurer to withdraw the premium directly from its cash value to avoid cancellation."
life-insurance-faq-1,What is a contestability period?,"A policy's contestable period is typically two years from its inception during which insurers can investigate potential misstatements or concealments made when applying for coverage. If such misrepresentations are found, the insurer may choose to rescind or cancel the policy."
life-insurance-faq-1,What is the “return of premium” feature?,"Term policies may include a rider known as ""return of premium"" which refunds all or part of the premiums paid if there's no claim during the policy term. These plans typically come with higher premiums compared to standard term policies; it is crucial to ensure timely payments to leverage this feature fully."
life-insurance-faq-1,What are accelerated death benefits?,"Terminal illness provisions in certain insurance policies enable policyholders to withdraw a substantial part of the death benefit during their lifetime, which can then be utilized for medical costs or other personal purposes before passing away. The sum taken early will be deducted from the total death benefit alongside accrued interest."
life-insurance-faq-1,What is a term policy?,"Term life insurance provides coverage for a specified period (one or multiple years), paying out a death benefit if the insured individual dies during that timeframe. Even though you may outlive the policy term, your investment remains sound – similar to purchasing auto insurance but never filing a claim. The primary advantage of term life insurance is its affordability, as these policies generally come with lower premiums compared to other types of life insurance. Furthermore, you can often renew term policies over time, maintaining coverage despite changes in your health status. Nevertheless, keep in mind that renewal comes with potential increases in premiums."
life-insurance-faq-1,There are four kinds of term policies:,"1. In level term policies, the death benefit amount will remain the same for the entire term. Depending on the policy, your premiums may be level or may increase over the term.
2. Decreasing term policies have a death benefit that decreases over the term. Your premium will typically remain the same throughout the term. People who purchase decreasing term policies usually have financial obligations that decrease over time (such as mortgage payments or loans).
3. Annual renewable term policies have a death benefit that remains the same throughout the term, but a premium that increases each year as you get older.
4. Convertible term policies allow you to convert the policy into a permanent policy, typically without a medical exam or further underwriting. Generally, this does increase your premium payment and must be done before you reach age 65."
life-insurance-faq-1,How much life insurance do I need?,"To determine how much life insurance you need, it’s best to look at your surviving family’s immediate, ongoing, and future financial obligations, and compare that with your financial resources. Below are examples of each type of need:
• Immediate: funeral costs, medical bills, taxes.
• Ongoing: mortgage payments, utilities, food.
• Future: college tuition, retirement funds.
Financial resources can include your partner’s income, savings, income-producing assets, and investments. Considering all these obligations and resources, the difference between the two is how much life insurance you need."
life-insurance-faq-1,Am I still eligible for coverage if I have a serious health condition?,"When evaluating insurance plans, most providers will necessitate medical examinations and assess fees according to the associated risk levels determined by these tests. Even if you're in poor health or dealing with significant medical conditions, certain guaranteed acceptance policies may still be accessible; however, these come with increased premium costs and reduced coverage limits compared to other alternatives."
life-insurance-faq-1,What is a graded benefit life insurance policy?,"Graded Benefit Life Insurance policies from insurance providers serve as a solution for those who cannot obtain standard coverage due to their health status. These policies limit the death benefit payment during the first two or three years after purchase. For example, if you buy $10,000 worth of coverage, the insurer will initially pay 40% if you pass away within the first year, followed by 75% in the second year, and 100% starting from the third year. It's crucial to carefully consider these plans and opt for a Level Benefit Plan instead, which features no waiting period, whenever possible."
life-insurance-faq-1,Do I need life insurance for my child?,"A child’s policy can provide a saving vehicle, the ability to buy more coverage in the future without proving insurability and pay the death benefit in the event of a child’s death, which can be used for burial expenses. However, most child coverages aren’t large enough to begin with (maximum benefit is typical $25,000)."
life-insurance-faq-1,What is the underwriting process?,"Life insurance underwriters evaluate applications for coverage by considering factors such as medical exams, applicant responses, and data from databases like Medical Information Bureau, prescription database report, and Motor Vehicle Report to determine if they should accept, reject, or adjust premiums for a policy."
life-insurance-faq-1,Should I buy no-questions-asked life insurance?,"No-questions-asked life insurance, often referred to as guaranteed issue life insurance, offers unconditional approval without considering one's current or past medical history. However, such policies come with certain drawbacks. First, they include a graded benefit clause that restricts the full death benefit payment during the first two policy years. Second, these policies tend to be significantly more expensive compared to traditional life insurance options, with a maximum death benefit capped at $40,000. Lastly, applicants must fall within the age range of 40 to 85 to be eligible, leaving out those under 40. Therefore, it is generally advised to only consider guaranteed issue coverage as a last resort after exploring and exhausting all other affordable life insurance alternatives."
life-insurance-faq-1,How long does it take to get my policy?,"The duration of the underwriting process for life insurance coverage varies depending on the insurer and the specific plan chosen. For a standard, comprehensive application process, it typically takes between 2 to 8 weeks. Conversely, a no-examination or simplified issue policy may be approved within just a few minutes to up to 2 weeks. After the policy has been authorized, the delivery period ranges approximately 1 week."
life-insurance-faq-1,Do I need to take an exam?,"Life insurance providers differ in their requirements for applicants. Traditional policies typically necessitate medical examinations before approval, but some insurers offer policies with up to $1 million in coverage that don't require exams. Final expense policies, which provide lower coverage amounts, can be issued based on simplified underwriting criteria, avoiding the need for medical tests."
life-insurance-faq-1,Why do I need to take an exam?,"Insurers are on the hook for millions if you die soon after getting the policy. They increase their odds by conducting an exam and consequently decide how risky you are to insure. Additionally, they make sure not to insure the unqualified individuals who may have a terminal illness or otherwise are likely to die soon."
life-insurance-faq-1,What do the insurance companies test for?,"During the nursing assessment for a health screening or job application process, expect a licensed healthcare professional to review your answers from the questionnaire, measure your vital signs (pulse, blood pressure), record your height and weight, draw a blood specimen, and potentially collect a urine sample and electrocardiogram (ECG) based on your age and the specific requirements of the organization."
life-insurance-faq-1,What is a death benefit?,"Life insurance death benefit is the amount of money the insurance company pays the designated beneficiaries upon the insured’s death, provided the policy was in force at the time of the incident."
life-insurance-faq-1,What is a beneficiary?,"A life insurance beneficiary is an individual, entity, trustee, or estate named by the policy owner to collect the death benefit proceeds upon the insured’s death."
life-insurance-faq-2,What is a final expense life insurance?,"Final expense life insurance refers to specific protection individuals purchase to cover charges and affairs that are associated with your such as burial, funeral service, or final medical bills. Final expense policies are whole life with a fixed premium amount that lasts for as long as the insured lives."
life-insurance-faq-2,Which one is better: Term life insurance or permanent?,"Term life insurance is generally considered the better option due to its affordability and flexibility. It provides substantial coverage at a lower cost compared to other types of policies, making it ideal for covering short-term financial obligations such as mortgage balances and supporting young children. However, certain situations may warrant considering a permanent policy, particularly for estate planning purposes or when purchasing a smaller final expense policy."
life-insurance-faq-2,What are life insurance riders?,"Life insurance riders are optional features that can be included in a life insurance policy to modify its coverage according to individual requirements. These riders often come at no extra charge, being already incorporated into the base coverage. Purchasing riders is done simultaneously with obtaining the policy and cannot be added later."
life-insurance-faq-2,Where can I get life insurance quotes?,Conduct thorough research on the insurance broker before deciding which one to partner with instead of solely focusing on finding the lowest rate. The choice of the appropriate broker plays a crucial role in securing the most suitable coverage.
life-insurance-faq-2,What if I die without life insurance?,"Life insurance provides financial protection for one's family when the insured passes away, covering costs such as burial expenses and outstanding debts like mortgages. It serves to alleviate potential financial hardships that survivors may face during their time of grief. To better understand life insurance policies, it's essential to distinguish between a ""funeral"" (a ceremony for the deceased) and ""proper disposal of the body"" (the process of preparing the body for cremation or interment)."
life-insurance-faq-2,Can I buy life insurance for anyone I choose?,"Life insurance policies allow individuals to secure coverage for others based on an ""insurable interest."" This means that having a close personal connection to the person being covered provides a valid reason to purchase life insurance. The most common relationships that give rise to insurable interest include spouses, children, and business owners who want to protect their key employees. Additionally, creditors may also obtain a policy on behalf of their borrowers as part of a loan agreement. By outlining these scenarios, we can better understand the concept of insurable interest and its role in life insurance underwriting."
life-insurance-faq-2,Can I get a better price if I buy directly from the insurer?,"Life insurance rates are predetermined by laws and regulations overseen by state departments of insurance, ensuring fairness and consistency in pricing. This enables insurance carriers, brokers, and agents to operate competitively without causing confusion for customers. Clients benefit from working with brokers who can compare offerings from various providers, ultimately securing them the most suitable policy for their unique circumstances at no additional cost."
life-insurance-faq-2,Can I buy more than one policy?,"Sure, you can, provided there is a financial need for it. You may want to supplement your current policy from work or add another term life insurance because you just had a new addition to the family. The insurance company is more interested in the total death benefit amount you currently hold rather than in how many policies you have."
life-insurance-faq-2,What are risk classifications?,"Risk classification, also called health classification, is a method the underwriter uses to determine the risk, you pose to the insurance carrier. A fundamental concept is the higher the risk, the more you will pay in premiums, the less of a risk, the less you will spend."
life-insurance-faq-2,How does the insurer know I died?,"Your designated beneficiary will have to file a claim with the carrier. He will also need to supply the death certificate (not a copy) along with the deceased’s policy number, social security number, and address."
life-insurance-faq-2,How much life insurance can I buy?,"When determining life insurance coverage, it's essential to align your protection with your financial worth. Various factors come into play when justifying the desired sum, such as your assets and debts. However, many insurers use a straightforward approach based on age and liability levels.
Younger applicants typically require greater coverage due to having dependents (young children) and larger mortgages. As individuals grow older and accumulate fewer responsibilities, their required coverage decreases. To help calculate the optimal coverage level, consider the following guidelines:

•	For ages up to 40: Aim for 35 times your annual earnings.
•	Between ages 41 and 50: Opt for 25 times your annual earnings.
•	From ages 51 to 60: Cover around 20 times your annual earnings.
•	Between ages 61 and 70: Secure coverage equal to approximately 10 times your annual earnings.
•	After age 70: Decrease coverage to 5 times your annual earnings.

These recommendations provide a general framework for estimating appropriate coverage amounts based on age and financial obligations. Keep in mind that individual circumstances may warrant different decisions, and it's always wise to consult with a professional before making any final choices."
life-insurance-faq-2,Why do insurers care about a felony conviction?,"Insurance providers specialize in assessing risks, and when it comes to evaluating potential clients with a criminal record, they consider them higher-risk candidates. As a result, insurance firms typically decline to offer policies or charge exorbitant premiums to those convicted of felonies. However, there's one exception: If you're a former convict who has maintained a clean record for more than ten years, you might still be able to secure affordable coverage. This leniency towards long-time offenders stems from the belief that their likelihood of recidivism decreases significantly after such a period. In fact, according to studies, approximately two-thirds (67.8%) of released inmates are rearrested within three years of their release. Therefore, if you become incarcerated during the first three years post-conviction, your insurer may choose to void your policy due to the increased risk associated with your incarceration. Nonetheless, once you've served more than ten years behind bars, insurers are less likely to deny or heavily scrutinize your application, making it possible to obtain reasonably priced coverage despite your past convictions."
life-insurance-faq-3,What to do if my application was declined?,"First, understand why you were denied coverage in the first place (see a letter of declination if you don’t know the reason). Second, get a good broker and disclose those facts to see if they can match you with a different insurer. The worst thing you can do is to apply to eight different companies to see who can issue you a policy because the more you get declined, the easier it is for other companies to follow suit and not approve your policy."
life-insurance-faq-3,What is accidental death and dismemberment insurance?,"Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance policy, which provides financial compensation to designated beneficiaries only in cases where the insured dies due to an accident. The policy specifically excludes coverage for deaths resulting from illnesses such as cancer, heart attacks, strokes, or other diseases."
life-insurance-faq-3,Do I need life insurance if I have it through my employer?,"Most people likely have group health insurance provided by their employer; however, this type of coverage often lacks portability. If you leave or lose your job, you'll also lose your insurance benefits. Moreover, group plans usually only provide limited financial security, typically covering 2 or 3 times your annual salary—a figure that may not be adequate for most individuals' needs. It is advisable to enroll in any workplace group plan that is both affordable and accessible, while simultaneously securing additional life insurance coverage from external sources to ensure comprehensive protection. The ideal amount of life insurance coverage should ideally equal ten times your annual income."
life-insurance-faq-3,What is Universal Life insurance?,"Universal Life Insurance, or UL, is a versatile and comprehensive financial product that combines elements of term life insurance and whole life insurance. It offers a guaranteed payout upon the policyholder's demise, tax-advantaged growth of its cash value component, and unparalleled adaptability regarding premium payments. The premiums consist of two main components: one for covering the insurance costs (Cost of Insurance, COI) and another for accumulating wealth within the policy through interest earnings."
life-insurance-faq-3,What is Key Person Life insurance?,Key Person Life Insurance is a type of coverage purchased by businesses to protect themselves from financial loss due to the untimely demise of essential employees who possess unique skills or talents.
life-insurance-faq-3,Why do insurers ask me about my family history?,"Life insurance underwriters evaluate the risk associated with insuring individuals based on factors related to their health status. If a parent has certain chronic illnesses like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or stroke, there's an increased chance that the child (the person being insured) may also develop these conditions. However, having one of these conditions does not automatically disqualify someone from obtaining life insurance; instead, they will face higher premiums due to the elevated risk. It's important to note that insurers typically focus on deaths occurring within the first 60 years of an immediate family member and do not deny coverage unless other high-risk factors are present."
life-insurance-faq-3,I Filed for Bankruptcy. Why did the life insurer deny my application?,"Having a bankruptcy on your record poses another risk to the insurance company. If you just had a bankruptcy, the insurer believes that you will not pay for the coverage you just acquired."
life-insurance-faq-3,What is mortgage life insurance?,"Mortgage Protection Insurance (MPI) is a type of life insurance that covers your mortgage payments if you pass away. The payout goes directly to your lender, not your loved ones. Furthermore, the coverage amount decreases as your mortgage balance reduces over time."
life-insurance-faq-3,"If I stop smoking today, will I get a non-smoker rate?","To secure the most competitive non- smoker rates, it's essential to abstain from tobacco use for 3 to 5 consecutive years, although individual insurers may have varying guidelines. In some cases, you might be eligible for a standard non- smoker rate after only 12 months of nicotine-free living. However, always remember to be truthful when disclosing your smoking habits to your insurance provider, as dishonesty can lead to claim denials or policy cancellations."
life-insurance-faq-3,What is the difference between term life insurance and permanent life insurance?,"Life insurance can be categorized into two main types: term life and permanent life. Term life covers you for a specified duration (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years), offering affordability without accumulating cash value. Permanent life, however, lasts throughout one's lifetime, building cash value that can be tapped later and often incorporating investment components."
life-insurance-faq-3,Can I borrow against the cash value of my permanent life insurance policy?,"Yes, with certain types of permanent life insurance policies, such as whole life or
universal life, you can borrow against the cash value. But first, consider the potential impact on the death benefit and consult with your insurance provider to understand the terms and conditions of borrowing against your policy."
life-insurance-faq-3,How are life insurance premiums determined?,"Life insurance premiums are calculated considering several elements: the kind of plan, the sum assured, the age and well-being of the covered individual, personal habits, and the term length of the policy. Typically, lower premiums are charged for younger and healthier candidates."
life-insurance-faq-3,How much life insurance coverage do I need?,"Determine the right life insurance cover requires evaluating personal circumstances like income, debt, family responsibilities, and seeking advice from professionals for financial planning."
life-insurance-faq-3,Is the death benefit from a life insurance policy taxable?,"Generally, the death benefit received from a life insurance policy isn't taxed as part of one's income; however, there might be specific circumstances where it does get taxed, such as when the policy possesses particular features or if the deceased person's estate surpasses a significant threshold (which could then lead to estate taxes). To understand how these rules apply to you personally, consulting with a tax professional would be ideal."
life-insurance-faq-4,What Is Life Insurance?,"Life insurance acts as a financial safeguard for your loved ones after your death. By paying regular premiums, you allow the insurer to pay a specified amount (the ""death benefit"") to designated beneficiaries upon your passing. This financial aid helps cover daily expenses, mortgages, and educational costs, ensuring your family's security during tough times. Life insurance mainly comes in two types: term and permanent. Term life covers a specific period, while permanent life policies, like whole life or universal life, offer lifelong coverage."
life-insurance-faq-4,How to Find the Best Life Insurance Policy?,"When searching for life insurance, assess carriers based on their financial strength, as stronger firms typically maintain lower rates over time and provide better customer support during economic downturns. Avoid assuming price competitiveness; each insurer has a unique pricing strategy, especially for cash value policies where differences can significantly affect long-term returns. Request detailed cost information, including expense charges and the actual cost of insurance, when comparing quotes. Finally, thoroughly review universal life illustrations, particularly the detailed expense pages or policy accounting pages, as lower-premium products may have higher internal costs, diminishing future cash value growth."
life-insurance-faq-4,What are the different types of Life Insurance?,There are two primary types of life insurance: term life and permanent life.
life-insurance-faq-4,What is Term life insurance? ,"Term life insurance is a policy where you select the duration of coverage, such as 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. If you die within that term, your beneficiary receives the death benefit. If you outlive the term and don't renew the policy (at a higher cost), there is no death benefit. Term life insurance is ideal for those who want to address specific financial concerns, like income replacement during their working years."
life-insurance-faq-4,What is Permanent life insurance? ,"Permanent life insurance provides a guaranteed death benefit payout upon the policyholder's death, regardless of timing. It also includes a cash value component that accumulates tax-deferred interest over time. Whole life and universal life are common types of permanent life insurance. These plans are suitable for individuals looking to support dependents, establish trusts for heirs, build retirement wealth, or seek lifelong coverage with flexible premiums."
life-insurance-faq-4,What is Whole life insurance? ,"Whole life insurance is predictable because the premiums, rate of cash value growth, and amount of the death benefit are fixed and guaranteed."
life-insurance-faq-4,What is Universal life insurance?,"This type of insurance offers more flexibility, allowing you to adjust premium payments and death benefits within certain limits. The cash value growth depends on the insurer and the performance of the invested assets underlying the policy. Types of universal life insurance include fixed-rate universal, guaranteed universal, indexed universal, or variable universal."
life-insurance-faq-4,What is Variable life insurance?,"Variable life insurance offers flexibility, allowing you to control investment choices for your cash value, which can lead to potential growth. However, there is a guaranteed minimum death benefit, ensuring financial protection regardless of market performance. Unlike variable universal life policies, premiums cannot be altered throughout the term. Cash value accumulation is possible, providing additional funds during your lifetime, but maintaining a minimum balance is crucial to prevent policy lapsing."
life-insurance-faq-4,What is No-Exam Life Insurance?,No-exam life insurance policies do not require a medical exam but may involve answering health-related questions.
life-insurance-faq-4,What is guaranteed issue life insurance?,"Guaranteed issue life insurance requires no medical exam or health questions, and you cannot be turned down."
life-insurance-faq-4,What is Burial insurance?,"Also known as funeral insurance or final expense insurance, burial insurance typically has a small death benefit intended to cover final expenses, such as $10,000."
life-insurance-faq-4,What is mortgage life insurance?,"Mortgage life insurance pays off your mortgage if the policyholder dies, with the payment going directly to the mortgage lender."
life-insurance-faq-4,How Much Does a Life Insurance Policy Cost?,"The average cost for a 10-year, $250,000 term life insurance policy for a 40-year-old man is $192 annually, compared to $276 annually for a $500,000 policy and $420 annually for a $1 million policy. For a 40-year-old woman, the average cost is $168 annually for a $250,000 policy, $264 annually for a $500,000 policy, and $336 annually for a $1 million policy."
life-insurance-faq-4,What Does Life Insurance Cover?,"Life insurance covers death from illness, accidents, and old age, including diseases, falls, car accidents, and Covid. Deaths from accidental drug overdoses are also covered. A specific type of life insurance, called accidental death and dismemberment, covers only accidental deaths, such as falls or car crashes, but not deaths from illness, disease, or old age."
life-insurance-faq-4,Do I Need Life Insurance?,"If someone relies on you financially—either now or after your death—you might need life insurance. Many purchase life insurance to provide income replacement for their families in the event of an unexpected death. Some use life insurance to fund a trust for providing financial support after their death, such as for a child with special needs. Other common reasons for buying life insurance include:
- Covering funeral costs.
- Providing money for family members to pay off a mortgage or other debts.
- Ensuring funds for children’s college tuition if a parent dies.
- Creating supplemental income during retirement years through a cash value policy.
- Providing funds to pay estate taxes for beneficiaries inheriting large taxable estates."
life-insurance-faq-5,What's covered if I become disabled?,"Many insurance policies include a ""waiver of premium"" rider: If you become disabled and can't work, this rider will cover your premium payments, keeping your insurance policy active. This option can be valuable and is often relatively inexpensive. However, life insurance does not provide benefits for disability. For income replacement when you are unable to work due to illness or injury, you will need short- or long-term disability insurance."
life-insurance-faq-5,How can I save money when buying life insurance?,Opting for a term life policy or a combination of term and permanent insurance can result in lower premiums. Purchasing a policy at a younger age can also help secure a lower premium.
life-insurance-faq-5,What is a beneficiary and why is it important to designate one?,"To ensure that your benefits go to the intended recipients, you must designate a beneficiary – the individual(s) who will receive the proceeds of your life insurance policy upon your death. Without a named beneficiary, the proceeds will be distributed according to the insurance contract, potentially going to family members or your estate. Regularly review your beneficiary designations to keep them up to date, considering life changes such as marriage, death, or other significant events."
life-insurance-faq-5,Why should I choose a reputable insurance company?,"A reputable life insurance company should be financially stable, have a solid claims payment history, excellent customer service, and competitive pricing. Insurance company ratings can be found online to help you make an informed decision."
life-insurance-faq-5,What are the different types of life insurance?,"The main types of life insurance are term, whole life, universal life, final expense, guaranteed issue, and group insurance."
life-insurance-faq-5,What is term life insurance?,"Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period, usually between 10 and 30 years. It is often referred to as “pure life insurance” because it has no cash value component. Its primary purpose is to provide a payout to beneficiaries if the insured dies during the term."
life-insurance-faq-5,What is whole life insurance?,"Whole life insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that provides lifelong coverage. It includes a cash value component, where part of the premium is invested and grows tax-deferred. Whole life insurance features a level premium, guaranteed death benefit, and guaranteed cash values that grow at a fixed rate."
life-insurance-faq-5,What is universal life insurance?,"Universal life insurance is another form of permanent insurance that offers cash value and lifelong coverage similar to whole life insurance, but with flexible premiums."
life-insurance-faq-5,What is final expense insurance?,"Final expense insurance is intended to cover end-of-life expenses, such as funeral and burial costs. It provides permanent coverage as long as premiums are paid but does not have a cash value component. This type of insurance is often chosen by older individuals without dependent children to ease the financial burden on loved ones."
life-insurance-faq-5,What is guaranteed issue life insurance?,"Guaranteed issue life insurance does not require a medical exam, making it suitable for older individuals or those with serious health conditions who might not qualify for other policies. Simplified issue policies are similar in that they also do not require a medical exam."
life-insurance-faq-5,What is group life insurance?,"Group life insurance is typically offered through an employer or member organization as part of a benefits package. Most group life insurance policies are term, but some employers offer permanent coverage options as a voluntary benefit."
life-insurance-faq-5,What are riders?,"Riders are add-ons that customize your policy. Some common riders include:
-	Disability waiver of premium: Pays premiums during a disability.
-	Chronic care: Allows access to a portion of the death benefits for long-term care.
-	Living benefit: Enables terminally ill individuals to use part of the death benefits for treatment.
-	Option to purchase paid-up additions: Allows additional payments to build cash value and increase the death benefit."
